2. **Listen to Users**: Early feedback is invaluable

4. **Focus on Retention**: Downloads don't matter if users don't stick
5. **Be Patient**: Most successful apps take 6-12 months to gain traction

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering**: Don't build features users don't want
2. **Ignoring App Store Optimization**: Good apps can fail with poor ASO
3. **No Marketing Plan**: Build it and they will come is a myth
4. **Competing on Features**: Focus on user experience instead
5. **Giving Up Too Early**: Success often comes after multiple iterations
