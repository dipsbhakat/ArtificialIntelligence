This is a professional headshot generator application built with Python and Streamlit. The application focuses on:

- Image processing using OpenCV and PIL
- AI-powered face detection with MediaPipe
- Professional photo enhancement techniques
- Background removal and replacement
- User-friendly web interface with Streamlit

## Key Technologies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image manipulation
- **MediaPipe**: Face detection and analysis
- **rembg**: Background removal
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex image processing operations
